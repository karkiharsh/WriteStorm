Thousands of devices, apps, or users send events very frequently:

Examples:

A fitness tracker uploading heart rate every second

A stock market app sending price updates every 100ms

A taxi app updating driver GPS positions

A logging system receiving millions of log messages

IoT temperature sensors pinging every second

A game server sending live player position updates

These events create massive write load → databases get overwhelmed.
